            <h1><strong>SMITE - MOBA game by Hirez-Studios</strong></h1>
            <br>
            <h1>What is Smite?</h1>
            <p>Smite is a free-to-play, third-person multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Hi-Rez Studios.</p>
            <p>In Smite, players control a god, goddess, or other mythological figure, and take part in team-based combat, using their abilities and tactics against other player-controlled gods and non-player-controlled minions.
                The game has multiple player versus player (PVP) modes, many playable characters, and has a successful esports scene with multiple tournaments, including the annual million-dollar Smite World Championship.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Key Features</h1>
            <br>
            <b><h2>Be a God</h2></b>
            <p>Cut through your enemies, encase them in ice, or drown them in a vortex of souls. 
                Assume direct control of your godlike avatar and experience the MOBA genre up close with the game camera directly behind your character.
                Choose from a long list of well-known and more obscure gods, each with their own history, special abilities and unique play style.</p>

            <b><h2>Tactical Gameplay</h2></b>
            <p>Master and use your godlike abilities to fulfill key roles such as damage dealer, tanking, crowd control, and support. 
                Explore the map and defeat NPC enemies for increased gold and buffs that help both you and your allies. 
                Then deny your opponents victory with perfectly-timed stuns and calculated ambushes.</p>

            <b><h2>Mythical Setting</h2></b>
            <p>Two teams composed of 1 to 5 players fight to defeat their opponents in several unique battlegrounds. 
                From the Roman Colosseum and the Siege of Mount Olympus, to the Ancient Pyramids of Egypt and the battlefield of Ragnarök.</p>

            <b><h2>Power Up</h2></b>
            <p>Within a single match, your god levels from 1 to 20, causing your abilities to gain strength. 
                You can purchase in-game items, consumables and relics to benefit your god and complement your personal play style – whether it's buffing your Offensive, Defensive or Utility capabilities.</p>

            <b><h2>Calculated Strikes</h2></b>
            <p>Every attack in SMITE is a skill shot that you control. Ranged attacks are carefully aimed, melee attacks properly positioned, and Area of Effect damage must be ground-targeted. 
                Predict your enemies' movements and hit your mark for maximum effect in fast-paced combat.</p>

            <b><h2>Free-to-Play</h2></b>
            <p>Everything affecting gameplay in SMITE can be earned simply by playing the game. 
                Players have access to an initial set of playable gods for free, while additional gods are unlocked through gameplay time or more quickly through micro-transactions. 
                Cosmetic skins can be purchased for further customization.
                You can also purchase the Ultimate God Pack, which will unlock every single god that has been released thus far, plus any other gods that will be released in the future, forever.</p>
